        <p class="body-2">Through my network I connected to Global CI, an IT consultancy, who felt their current website portrayed their company as a “staffing agency” and were looking for a revamp. They also had recently launched a new logo for their company and wanted to refresh their branding to match.</p>

        <h2 class="subhead-2">Challenge</h2>    
        <p class="body-2">Global CI struggled to communicate their offerings to their customers through content, website layout, and downloadable assets. This meant their website was drawing minimum traffic and not being utilitized as a business generator. Without a dedicated UX team (or web manager, product owner, etc), they needed outside help to accomplish this.

There were three main pages and the 8 tabs of high level navigation linked to anchors among the three pages. </p>

Since I inherited this project from another designer, I already had information on color schemes, page set ups, and tones of the sites. The analysis left is what I presented to the CEO as a condensed version of my research. It highlighted how competitors did some of the things on the client’s wishlist along with other main sections we needed to be competitive.</p>

Using Optimal Workshop, we sent out a card sorting activity to team members, established clients, and other stakeholders. The 35 cards were created by the CEO and the categories were inspired by the most popular categories from the 6 competitor sites (home page, company, services/products, resources, and a ‘trash’ option if they felt it didn’t belong). Participants could also create their own categories.</p>
