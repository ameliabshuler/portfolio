		<p class="body"><u>Background</u></p>
		<p class="body d-inline">Through my network I connected to Global CI, an IT consultancy, who felt their current website portrayed their company as a “staffing agency” and were looking for a revamp. They also had recently launched a new logo for their company and wanted to refresh their branding to match.</p>

		<p class="body"><u>Challenge</u></p>
		<p class="body d-inline">Global CI struggled to communicate their offerings to their customers through content, website layout, and downloadable assets. This meant their website was drawing minimum traffic and not being utilitized as a business generator. Without a dedicated UX team (or web manager, product owner, etc), they needed outside help to accomplish this.</p>

		<p class="body d-inline">Looking beyond the inconsistencies in the user interface (varying type faces, display issues on smaller browser sizes, spacing, etc), I wanted to know how users were currently finding the site, how they were interacting with it, and how the content is set up. What I found was that most searches were direct from a desktop, and nearly 2/3 of users left immediately. There were three main pages and the 8 tabs of high level navigation linked to anchors among the three pages.</p>

		<p class="body d-inline">I looked at 6 companies identified by the client as key competitors. Since I inherited this project from another designer, I already had information on color schemes, page set ups, and tones of the sites. The analysis left is what I presented to the CEO as a condensed version of my research. It highlighted how competitors did some of the things on the client’s wishlist along with other main sections we needed to be competitive.</p>

		<p class="body d-inline">I had the client come up with what he felt needed to be on the site (a list of 35 items). Using Optimal Workshop, we sent out a card sorting activity to team members, established clients, and other stakeholders. The 35 cards were created by the CEO and the categories were inspired by the most popular categories from the 6 competitor sites (home page, company, services/products, resources, and a ‘trash’ option if they felt it didn’t belong). Participants could also create their own categories.</p>

However, the client brought up the idea since Healthcare, Government, and Commercial users might be looking for different information. I worked to create detailed personas and revised them based on client feedback. We used these personas to rationalize decisions we made that weren’t informed by the card-sorting.</p>

		<p class="body d-inline">While reviewing the inital wireframe layout for the “What We Offer” page, we realized we needed a different approach to be able to tailor general capabilities (ex. Cloud Migration) to specific industries (ex. Cloud Migration with patient data in a healthcare setting). How were others addressing this? I went through three new sites: Leidos, CTG, and Centric to analyze how they incorporated the capabilities they had with the industries they served.</p>
