		<p class="p-0 m-0 body-2 d-inline">It was March 2020, and like every other American I decided it was the perfect time to begin fostering cats and dogs. I found Humane Rescue Alliance (HRA), <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2020/03/16/humane-rescue-alliance-seeks-more-adopters-and-foster-homes/">the largest animal welfare organization in the DC area.</a> After a quick application and approval, I was sent orientation emails and put into two foster Google Groups– one for cats and one for dogs. Almost immediately, my daily inbox spiked from my usually 1-2 emails to 15-20 from other foster parents.</p>

Thank you.' message 3 'There is a link at the bottom of every email to unsubscribe. No need to email the full group.' message 4 'Hi all, Hopefully someone from HRA will address this again (since it seems to come up every few weeks), but if you want tofoster an HRA dog, you *must* be on the listserv.'" class="w-100 border-hero my-2">
	</div>
	<div class="row col-md-8 py-2 mx-auto">
		<p class="body-2">I was overwhelmed, but I wasn’t alone. Other new foster parents voiced their concerns over the emails. There had to be a better way to communicate requests for foster pet supplies. I reached out to the foster program director to volunteer my ability as a UX designer. She told me in a normal month, HRA receives around 70 foster parent applications; however, in March of 2020, they had roughly 1,300 people volunteer to take care of animals. As a volunteer-based organization, she was thrilled at the offer for free help.

		<p class="body-2">I created ‘proto-personas.’ Basically, ideas of who I thought were in the group and user types I wanted to interview. I noticed those asking for supplies usually mentioned they were first-time fosters, which is why they didn’t have these things prepared when they were matched with a pet. Those offering supplies were usually long-time foster parents, or those with resident pets who no longer needed the item they were giving away.

		In all honesty, these personas are overkill. They helped me put thoughts on paper at the beginning, but without a team to share these with they weren’t particularly useful in a recurring manner. Personas help create a shared understanding of the intended user for large teams. If someone joined my team, I would revise and update these profiles. However, since it is just me, I didn’t spend any more time on this than necessary.

		I conducted 13 half-hour interviews. I opted not to record because I had 2 interviews with technical difficulties that resulted in a phone call, 4 scheduled interviews that were a no-call no-show, and had reached out to 30+ fosters in order to schedule the 13.

	<div class="row col-md-8 my-0 mx-auto">
		<p class="body-2">Out of the spreadsheet, the most competitive were Slack and Groups.io. After looking into Zapier for email automation, it became clear we were going to have to use the paid version and would still not have the same amount of options groups.io had for email preferences. We decided on groups.io and I began to refine the community.
		</p>
		<p class="body-2">Groups.io offers nearly endless features and can be overwhelming to set up. I did an informational interview with the moderator of the Cleveland Park groups.io page to see how a similar group ran their listserve.

		<h3 class="body-2 bold">Usability Testing</h3>
		<p class="body-2">I conducted 6 usability tests over Google Meets and had them share their screens while I recorded. I also took notes for the qualitative questions I asked. I tried to test from those within all demographics that would use the group– foster parents, volunteer case managers, technology-friendly users, and technology-adverse users.

		<p class="body-2">How would I quantify that? I was hoping by asking the question “how comfortable are you with technology (1-10, 10 being most comfortable)” users would self-identify their comfort level with technology. However, the users that had no issues with technology on the call (whether it was joining the call itself, or the platform) ranked themselves in the 6 range, and those who did have technology-issues (trouble getting on the call, screen sharing, or navigating the group) ranked themselves as a 10. Looking back, a better question might’ve been “how many times a day do you interact with the internet?” People who are comfortable may feel pressure to rank themselves lower, as to not appear overly confident. Those who aren’t as comfortable might feel they need to rank themselves higher, so as not to appear ‘under qualified.’ The unfortunate part of a usability test is it feels to users that THEY are being tested, not the technology.

	</div>
	<div class="row col-md-8 my-0 mx-auto">

		<p class="body-2">Additionally, 5 participants were confused by the two links in the sign-up email. One was how to use the group, and the other was joining the group. Users often clicked the first link (the guide), continued without reading the guide, and had to restart the task.

		<p class="body-2">Theme 3: Finally, the platform enforces the use of hashtags to categorize messages. This is only revealed on the web platform, but doesn’t explain what they are or how to use them. 4 of the users had trouble with the ‘hashtags’ while sending a post from the website version. They understood to add them, but were not expecting where they showed up (in the subject line). Most importantly, it wasn’t clear why they were necessary.
