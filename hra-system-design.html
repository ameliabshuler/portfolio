		<p class="body d-inline">It was March 2020, and like every other American I decided it was the perfect time to begin fostering cats and dogs. I found Humane Rescue Alliance (HRA),
		<a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2020/03/16/humane-rescue-alliance-seeks-more-adopters-and-foster-homes/">the largest animal welfare organization in the DC area. </a>After a quick application and approval, I was sent orientation emails and put into two foster Google Groups– one for cats and one for dogs. Almost immediately, my daily inbox spiked from my usually 1-2 emails to 15-20 from other foster parents.</p>

She told me in a normal month, HRA receives around 70 foster parent applications; however, in March of 2020, they had roughly 1,300 people volunteer to take care of animals. As a volunteer-based organization, she was thrilled at the offer for free help.</p>

Those offering supplies were usually long-time foster parents, or those with resident pets who no longer needed the item they were giving away.</p>

		<p class="body d-inline">How would I quantify that? I was hoping by asking the question “how comfortable are you with technology (1-10, 10 being most comfortable)” users would self-identify their comfort level with technology. However, the users that had no issues with technology on the call (whether it was joining the call itself, or the platform) ranked themselves in the 6 range, and those who did have technology-issues (trouble getting on the call, screen sharing, or navigating the group) ranked themselves as a 10. Looking back, a better question might’ve been “how many times a day do you interact with the internet?” People who are comfortable may feel pressure to rank themselves lower, as to not appear overly confident. Those who aren’t as comfortable might feel they need to rank themselves higher, so as not to appear ‘under qualified.’ The unfortunate part of a usability test is it feels to users that THEY are being tested, not the technology.</p>

		<p class="body d-inline">Theme 1: Of the 6 participants, 5 struggled to find the “join the group” button at the bottom of the page. The issue? The platform displayed the group’s ‘description’ along with subscription options. The button was out of frame. There was not enough to indicate that there was an action needed from the user.</p>

		<p class="body d-inline">Theme 2: Additionally, 5 participants were confused by the two links in the sign-up email. One was how to use the group, and the other was joining the group. Users often clicked the first link (the guide), continued without reading the guide, and had to restart the task.</p>

		<p class="body d-inline">Theme 3: Finally, the platform enforces the use of hashtags to categorize messages. This is only revealed on the web platform, but doesn’t explain what they are or how to use them. 4 of the users had trouble with the ‘hashtags’ while sending a post from the website version. They understood to add them, but were not expecting where they showed up (in the subject line). Most importantly, it wasn’t clear why they were necessary.</p>

		<p class="body d-inline">While this is a secondary goal for this round of usability testing, a future consideration must be how to convey the importance of hashtags while they are being used, and not in a separate training or guide. My main takeaway from all of this was that the majority of users will not read the user guide. Of the 6 users, only one looked at the user guide.</p>
