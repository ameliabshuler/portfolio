		<p class="body"><u>Challenge</u></p>
		<p class="body d-inline">In early 2017, Cummins planned to announce the consolidation of their franchises in the larger brand: Cummins, Inc. Before doing that they needed to consolidate stand alone sites for speciality engines, such as their Fire Pump Drive Engines produced in De Pere, WI. The site needed to be integrated into one of the larger brand sites as part of the consolidation effort.</p>

		<p class="body"><u>My Role</u></p>
		<p class="body d-inline">The product owner of the website had retired a few years prior and with no one updating the site, it had fallen into disrepair. I was brought in to evaluate the existing site, ideate new improvements, and mock up how it would fit into a larger brand site. I worked with internal stakeholders to align on business and internal user needs.</p>

		<p class="body d-inline">I interviewed my team about their current use of the site, and also their wishes for the future site. Because Cummins is a wholesaler and these engines were being repackaged and resold, we didn’t have access to the end site users.</p>

		<p class="body d-inline">Information from internal stakeholders revealed two main personas: those wishing to buy engines and those wishing to get their existing engines serviced. A smaller portion of users were looking to be trained to install engines; usually, these were people like engineers or technicians who would also be interested in servicing engines.</p>

		<p class="body"><u>Stakeholder Feedback</u></p>
		<p class="body d-inline">Stakeholders definitely liked that the new site was simpler and more organized by user type. There were a few things on which they were not willing to budge; the internal users found a lot of value in the ratings charts that explained what engine would work depending on the rating of the pump and they wanted to include the engine calculator. As an external user, these items felt redundant, but alas I found a way to incorporate them into the website. In further discussions, I discovered the unsightly table was actually key in determining which engine to pick up front. I think to this day still a user has not used the engine calculator.</p>
	</div>
	<!-- text -->
	<div class="mb-4">
		<p class="body"><u>Rating Charts</u></p>
		<p class="body d-inline">Internal users were unwilling to budge on the 4 rating charts listed in the left-hand navigation. Although this was displayed on the public website, they needed it as an internal resource tool and could not reliably host it on an internal server.</p>

		<p class="body"><u>Low Fidelity Prototype</u></p>
		<p class="body d-inline">Since I worked on this for only a month, I managed to get the framework of the pages done. The client wanted to iterate on page copy and photos after I was gone, and they requested I use a prototyping tool they were familiar so they could continue to edit after I left. Surprisingly, I was able to create a comparable prototype in Excel by linking cells together, changing cell color, and inserting photos. This was a tool they were able to use after I left.</p>
